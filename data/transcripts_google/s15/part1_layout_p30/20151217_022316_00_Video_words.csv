okay,16.6,17.0
then,17.0,17.4
I'm,17.4,17.5
another,17.5,17.8
block,17.8,18.1
on,18.1,18.3

it,21.9,22.0
so,22.0,22.2
it's,22.2,22.5
yeah,22.5,23.6
you,23.6,24.5
got,24.5,24.8
it,24.8,24.8
that,24.8,25.6
have,25.6,25.7
another,25.7,25.9
block,25.9,26.2
on,26.2,26.3

6th,31.6,32.0
like,32.0,32.3
that,32.3,32.5
like,32.5,32.8
that,32.8,32.9
pattern,32.9,33.2
cool,40.8,41.6
and,41.6,42.0
then,42.0,42.2
just,42.2,42.4
make,42.4,42.6
like,42.6,42.8
the,42.8,43.6
same,43.6,43.9
