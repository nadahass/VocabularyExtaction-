now,2.0,2.2
it's,2.2,2.6
getting,2.6,2.7
asymmetrical,2.7,3.5
so,3.5,4.2
start,4.2,5.3
bottom,5.3,5.7
layer,5.7,6.0
is,6.0,6.2
three,6.2,6.4
blocks,6.4,6.6
two,9.5,10.6
on,10.6,11.2
your,11.2,11.7
left,11.7,12.0
side,12.0,12.2
will,12.2,12.4
be,12.4,12.4
squeezed,12.4,13.1
together,13.1,13.3
just,13.3,14.7
horizontally,14.7,15.5
and,15.5,16.7
then,16.7,16.9
they'll,16.9,17.4
be,17.4,17.5
a,17.5,17.6
gap,17.6,17.9
of,17.9,18.0
almost,18.0,18.4
one,18.4,18.8
full,18.8,18.9
block,18.9,19.5
and,19.5,20.8
then,20.8,20.9
you,20.9,22.5
need,22.5,22.7
to,22.7,22.7
put,22.7,23.0
them,23.0,23.0
up,23.0,23.2
yeah,23.2,23.4
that's,23.4,24.3
good,24.3,24.5
okay,24.5,25.2
the,25.2,25.3
next,25.3,25.5
way,25.5,25.7
or,25.7,25.9
is,25.9,26.1
two,26.1,26.3
blocks,26.3,26.4
the,27.8,28.2
first,28.2,28.5
clock,28.5,28.7
goes,28.7,29.3
exactly,29.3,29.5
in,29.5,30.1
the,30.1,30.2
middle,30.2,30.6
of,30.6,31.1
those,31.1,31.4
too,31.4,31.7
but,31.7,33.3
yeah,33.3,33.8
and,33.8,34.5
then,34.5,34.7
the,34.7,34.8
other,34.8,34.9
one,34.9,35.1
goes,35.1,35.3
in,35.3,35.4
the,35.4,35.5
middle,35.5,35.7
of,35.7,35.9
the,35.9,36.2
two,36.2,36.4
blocks,36.4,36.8
right,36.8,37.1
in,37.1,37.2
the,37.2,37.3
gap,37.3,37.6
and,38.8,39.7
the,39.7,39.8
next,39.8,40.2
layers,40.2,40.5
another,40.5,40.9
2,40.9,41.1
so,42.9,43.2
the,43.2,43.4
first,43.4,43.7
one,43.7,43.9
will,43.9,44.6
be,44.6,44.7
just,44.7,45.3
spending,45.3,45.8
the,45.8,45.8
Gap,45.8,46.2
exactly,46.2,46.7
yep,48.8,49.4
and,49.4,49.7
I'm,49.7,49.9
the,49.9,50.0
other,50.0,50.2
one,50.2,50.6
hangs,50.6,51.3
over,51.3,51.5
the,51.5,51.7
edge,51.7,52.0
on,52.0,52.1
the,52.1,52.2
right,52.2,52.5
side,52.5,52.8
a,52.8,52.9
little,52.9,53.0
bit,53.0,53.3
right,53.3,53.6
next,53.6,53.8
to,53.8,53.9
that,53.9,54.1
one,54.1,54.3
no,55.1,56.1
on,56.1,56.4
the,56.4,56.5
same,56.5,56.8
level,56.8,57.1
yep,58.0,58.5
it,58.5,58.6
all,58.6,58.8
the,58.8,58.9
way,58.9,59.0
together,59.0,59.2
with,59.2,59.6
that,59.6,59.7
other,59.7,60.1
block,60.1,60.4
yep,60.4,61.3
and,61.3,61.8
then,61.8,62.0
one,62.0,62.2
more,62.2,62.5
on,62.5,62.7
the,62.7,62.7
top,62.7,63.0
and,67.7,68.4
slightly,68.4,69.1
to,69.1,69.7
your,69.7,69.8
right,69.8,70.6
perfect,72.3,73.0
I,73.9,73.9
think,73.9,74.4
that's,74.4,74.6
