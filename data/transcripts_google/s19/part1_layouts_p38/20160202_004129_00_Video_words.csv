need,99.0,99.2
one,99.2,99.5
of,99.5,99.7
the,99.7,99.9
block,99.9,100.6
so,100.6,101.2
it's,101.2,101.6
like,101.6,101.8
units,101.8,102.6
of,102.6,102.7
yes,102.7,103.6
you,103.6,103.9
can,103.9,104.2

to,126.6,126.7
you,126.7,127.0
both,127.0,127.3
like,127.3,127.7
line,127.7,128.0
segments,128.0,128.6
move,129.5,130.5
it,130.5,130.7
so,130.7,130.9
it,130.9,131.0
kind,131.0,131.2
of,131.2,131.3

less,138.1,138.4
yeah,141.3,141.7
that,141.7,142.7
works,142.7,143.1
and,143.1,143.4
then,143.4,143.5
kind,143.5,143.7
of,143.7,143.8
move,143.8,144.1
the,144.1,144.3
one,144.3,144.6
in,144.6,145.6
the,145.6,145.7
middle,145.7,145.8
to,145.8,146.8
