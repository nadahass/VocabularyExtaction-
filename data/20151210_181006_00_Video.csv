so what are we doing is I'm going to ask you to build the blocks in the exact way that I see it I see a 5 by 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 it's 5 by 8 survive tall 5 this way and ate this way um not every single Square on that grade is filled but what you doing might be easier for you to visualize so starting in your top left there is one block,0.9425978064537048
so one block in the top left on the first column on the first row and diagonally down to the right there is another block right there up and to the right there's another one and down to the right there's another one yep right there and then up to the right there's yet another one I may skip a spot in the upper right on the right side yet right there there's a block and then to its lower right there is what,0.9356302618980408
yep that works right so far to,0.8516836762428284
 so skipping down to now the third row there is a,0.8538575768470764

 yes the right there and there's a block and moving down to the fourth row there is any block not to not there would say the fourth place very very yes skip one spot and then there's another block and then one block at the very bottom of the fifth row in between those two blocks in the fourth row yes right there that looks about right to me home,0.9580559730529785
