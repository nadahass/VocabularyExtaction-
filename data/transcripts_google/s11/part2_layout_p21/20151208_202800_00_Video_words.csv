for,27.1,28.1
the,28.1,28.1
first,28.1,28.5
layer,28.5,28.7
will,28.7,29.0
for,29.0,29.5
let's,30.6,31.8
put,31.8,32.0
it,32.0,32.1
in,32.1,32.3
a,32.3,32.4
in,32.4,32.8
some,32.8,33.6

the,41.2,41.3
corners,41.3,41.7
yeah,41.7,42.5
exactly,42.5,42.8
let's,44.2,45.3
put,45.3,45.5
two,45.5,45.7
more,45.7,45.9
diamonds,45.9,46.2

top,50.4,50.9
exactly,50.9,53.1
yes,53.1,53.8
and,54.9,55.3
then,55.3,55.5
you,55.5,55.6
can,55.6,55.8
call,55.8,56.1
the,56.1,56.3
braids,56.3,56.5
that,56.5,56.5
so,56.5,56.8
that,56.8,56.9
it's,56.9,57.0
all,57.0,57.2
two,57.2,57.3
metrical,57.3,57.6
and,57.6,58.9
then,58.9,59.3
a,59.3,59.4
final,59.4,59.7
one,59.7,60.1
of,60.1,60.7
the,60.7,62.8
last,62.8,64.1
yeah,64.1,64.3
that's,64.3,64.7
