okay this one's easy over my Astra,0.9167966842651367
 I don't know if that'll make it easier on the first player let's start with that,0.8562735319137573
 several blocks Steve,0.7894411683082581
 6 blocks Maybe,0.7601016163825989
 and so the front you can put two next to each other in the front,0.9397050142288208
 closest to you,0.9865071177482605
 I have the right side out a little closer to you know just the right side of those two front blocks should be slightly closer,0.9567530155181885
 okay and then you can slide one block behind that front black,0.9460676312446594
 behind the one that's most front does the quantum closest you know not behind the one that's closest to you on the farther side,0.923814058303833
 no no,0.8771181106567383
 exactly yep and squeeze it together,0.839643657207489
 yeah but no gas,0.9209865927696228
 okay and then one more block behind that one,0.9623345136642456
 okay well yeah I guess I mean in front,0.9627497792243958
 yes so those those three blocks that you have they should create a staircase pattern going out so each one needs to be slid out just a little bit yeah exactly and then,0.9544489979743958
 yep that looks right,0.9896475672721863
 okay one more block added,0.9525468945503235
 that's it up the farthest one in farthest from you but one more block but on the inside of it,0.8955898284912109
 yeah right next to it,0.9862018823623657
 it could be squeezed all the way in closest to you,0.9395067691802979
 there you go,0.9449787139892578
 and,0.8147337436676025
 okay one more block,0.9552532434463501
 you can put it right in the gas I just squeeze it into that hole is close as you can,0.8820030093193054
 yeah,0.8781906366348267
 yep,0.5030427575111389
 okay,0.9486140608787537
 and then it looks like there's one more block on that bottom layer and it'll be all the way on the left next to the one you just slid,0.9478116631507874
 but slightly farther back away from you away from you just a little bit,0.9609915614128113
 Yeah but not as far as the the last row,0.9351766705513
 dogs good,0.8310062885284424
 okay I think that's all first layer so second layer,0.9345219731330872
 is 4 blocks,0.9018692970275879
 there's one block in the middle of the two closest to you,0.9045258164405823
 that's about right and then 3 blocks in just about a horizontal row right behind that,0.9454010725021362
 yes in French,0.9291770458221436
 yep in the one farthest to the right should hang off a little bit like you have it I think it's right now put it back like you had it,0.965776264667511
 and there should be a small gap between the one farthest on the right that you just touched and the other two so the other two you can slide the other way,0.9748468995094299
 oh but no actually I told you the wrong way sites like those to the other way they should be a little past the front one,0.8927101492881775
 just to know in the horizontal Direction like you were doing,0.8528273105621338
 so does all yep stop there and then create a small gap between those two and the last one,0.9109686017036438
 a little less,0.9056510329246521
 okay,1.0
 and there is a small gap between those first ones to very small,0.9513586759567261
 you got those too,0.6088604927062988
 okay I think that's right and then the last way or is just one block on the top,0.9093798398971558
 and it goes in the middle of those three that almost form a square on your left side,0.9515014290809631
 put it right on top of those in the middle,0.9551127552986145
 get a little closer to you,0.9239354133605957
 yeah,0.8551474213600159
 okay I think we have it,0.9841596484184265
