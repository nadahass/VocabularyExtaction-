I'll,0.0,0.2
take,0.2,0.4
one,0.4,0.7000000000000001
block,0.7000000000000001,1.2
and,1.2,1.5
put,1.5,1.8
it,1.8,1.9
in,1.9,2.0
front,2.0,2.3
of,2.3,2.4
you,2.4,2.6
as,2.6,2.7
a,2.7,2.8
daimond,2.8,3.5
and,5.1,5.6
then,5.6,5.8
you,5.8,6.0
want,6.0,6.2
then,9.0,9.6
so,9.6,10.3
there's,10.3,10.6
your,10.6,10.8
diamond,10.8,11.3
so,11.3,11.6
just,11.6,12.2
next,12.2,12.6
to,12.6,12.7
it,12.7,12.8
do,12.8,13.0
another,13.0,13.8
block,13.8,14.3
that's,14.3,14.5
match,14.5,16.7
it,16.7,16.8
up,16.8,16.9
that's,16.9,17.5
the,17.5,17.6
edges,17.6,18.0
up,18.0,18.3
that,18.3,21.0
would,21.0,21.1
work,21.1,21.4
with,21.4,21.5
this,21.5,21.7
so,21.7,22.3
now,22.3,22.5
put,22.5,22.8
one,22.8,23.2
in,23.2,23.8
the,23.8,24.0
center,24.0,24.3
of,24.3,25.0
of,25.0,25.9
where,25.9,26.1
the,26.1,26.2
edges,26.2,26.5
me,26.5,26.8
yes,26.8,27.3
don't,27.3,27.5
blow,27.5,27.7
it,27.7,27.7
in,27.7,28.0
there,28.0,28.4
you,28.4,28.6
go,28.6,28.7
that,28.7,29.1
wasn't,29.1,29.3
the,29.3,29.4
way,29.4,29.5
I,29.5,29.5
was,29.5,29.7
