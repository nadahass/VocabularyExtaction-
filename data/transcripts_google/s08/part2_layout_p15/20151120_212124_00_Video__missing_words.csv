right,151.6,152.7
corner,152.7,152.9
good,152.9,153.6
and,153.6,154.7
move,154.7,154.9
it,154.9,155.0
slightly,155.0,155.4
forward,155.4,155.9
rational,155.9,156.9
that,156.9,157.1
look,157.1,157.3
like,157.3,157.4
it,157.4,157.5
was,157.5,157.6
good,157.6,157.8
where,157.8,157.9
you,157.9,158.0

then,160.0,160.4
in,160.4,160.6
front,160.6,160.9
of,160.9,161.2
that,161.2,161.5
go,162.9,163.2
to,163.2,163.3
block,163.3,163.7
a,163.7,164.8
move,164.8,165.1
