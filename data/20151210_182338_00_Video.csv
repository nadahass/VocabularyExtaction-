this one is also another three-dimensional one,0.9434610605239868
 there's going to be four blocks at 804 kind of centered in the grid the grids not as relevant there cannot not be up a square rather they're going to be Dimond so they're going to be turn up 90° each block 90° yep just like that,0.925658106803894
 I would separate them a little separate the ones you left and right yet the front and back aren't as much separated,0.9301958680152893
 it's all good shape of this is,0.9127206206321716
 let's do the left and right so focus on the left and right locks I hate zero put one block on top of each though they're not diamond shapes their square-shaped now yes it's like that,0.8770768642425537
 there is,0.950808048248291
 now focus on the front and back diamonds there is there still there's going to be a block on top of each one of those but they're still diamond-shaped and they're going to be built in a pyramidal pure middleweight I guess so move the block on top of you either one of those I-80 near eat near to each other not those ones but the ones on there going to be an appears that they're not quite touching but they're more near to each other so you might want to move the blocks of heights zero farther away from each other yeah but only the ones nearest and farthest you not the ones on the left or the right,0.9590126872062683
 then there is a block stacked on top of those two that you just made yet it looks like it's whatever I haven't checked yet again and then focusing on the ones on the left or the right there is diamond shaped ones on this they're not touching the ones in the middle,0.9250773191452026
 and that looks about right,0.9804732203483582
