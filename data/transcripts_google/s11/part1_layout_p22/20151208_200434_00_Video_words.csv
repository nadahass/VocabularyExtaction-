more,4.3,4.5
like,4.5,4.5
a,4.5,4.7
tower,4.7,5.1
so,5.1,6.3
the,6.3,6.3
base,6.3,6.7
of,6.7,6.8
the,6.8,6.9
tower,6.9,7.1
is,7.1,7.8
four,7.8,8.1
blocks,8.1,8.3
start,8.3,9.1
with,9.1,9.2
four,9.2,9.6
and,9.6,10.9
put,10.9,11.1
them,11.1,11.2
in,11.2,11.4
a,11.4,11.5
square,11.5,11.8
with,11.8,13.7
a,13.7,13.9
small,13.9,14.4
space,14.4,14.8
between,14.8,14.9
all,14.9,15.4
of,15.4,15.5
them,15.5,15.6
just,16.7,17.2
maybe,17.2,17.6
half,17.6,17.9
an,17.9,18.0
inch,18.0,18.1
yeah,19.4,19.8
that's,19.8,20.4
good,20.4,20.4
and,22.6,23.1
now,23.1,23.2
there,23.2,23.5
will,23.5,23.6
be,23.6,23.8
two,23.8,24.0
columns,24.0,24.7
going,24.7,25.9
up,25.9,26.0
the,26.0,26.2
center,26.2,26.7
yeah,29.6,30.6
exactly,30.6,30.7
like,30.7,31.2
that,31.2,31.2
and,33.3,33.8
that's,33.8,34.0
two,34.0,34.2
blocks,34.2,34.6
high,34.6,34.8
so,34.8,35.0
just,35.0,35.3
put,35.3,35.4
one,35.4,35.7
on,35.7,36.0
top,36.0,36.1
of,36.1,36.4
each,36.4,36.6
one,36.6,36.7
of,36.7,36.8
those,36.8,36.9
and,39.1,39.6
then,39.6,39.9
put,39.9,40.3
one,40.3,40.5
block,40.5,40.8
in,40.8,41.0
the,41.0,41.2
middle,41.2,41.5
on,41.5,41.7
top,41.7,41.9
of,41.9,42.1
that,42.1,42.2
Optimus,44.4,45.7
Prime,45.7,46.1
I,48.2,48.6
think,48.6,48.9
that's,48.9,49.2
it,49.2,49.2
