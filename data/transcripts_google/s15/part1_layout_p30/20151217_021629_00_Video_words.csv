Word,Start (s),End (s)
so,7.9,9.2
I,9.2,9.3
can,9.3,9.4
have,9.4,9.5
a,9.5,9.6
block,9.6,9.9
then,11.7,12.1
have,12.1,12.2
another,12.2,12.4
block,12.4,12.8
like,12.8,13.0
on,13.0,13.1
the,13.1,13.2
same,13.2,13.6
just,13.6,13.7
like,13.7,13.9
a,13.9,14.0
space,14.0,14.3
away,14.3,14.6
from,14.6,14.6
it,14.6,14.9
but,14.9,15.9
then,15.9,16.2
turn,16.2,16.6
it,16.6,16.8
so,16.8,17.0
it's,17.0,17.3
yeah,20.3,21.3
pretty,21.3,21.5
much,21.5,21.6
and,21.6,22.3
then,22.3,22.6
I,22.6,22.7
guess,22.7,22.8
just,22.8,23.0
push,23.0,23.3
it,23.3,23.4
up,23.4,23.6
like,23.6,23.7
a,23.7,23.8
tiny,23.8,24.1
bit,24.1,24.3
but,24.3,24.6
not,24.6,24.7
too,24.7,24.8
much,24.8,25.0
okay,26.6,28.1
and,28.1,28.6
then,28.6,28.7
it's,28.7,29.7
centered,29.7,30.2
like,30.2,30.4
the,30.4,30.6
one,30.6,30.7
where,30.7,30.9
the,30.9,31.1
point,31.1,31.7
the,31.7,31.9
corner,31.9,32.2
isn't,32.2,32.4
pointing,32.4,32.8
out,32.8,32.9
yeah,32.9,33.1
that,33.1,33.3
one,33.3,33.4
then,33.4,34.4
you,34.4,34.4
can,34.4,34.6
have,34.6,34.7
another,34.7,34.8
block,34.8,35.3
like,35.3,35.7
a,35.7,35.7
weird,35.7,36.2
like,36.2,36.8
a,36.8,36.9
little,36.9,37.1
in,37.1,37.2
front,37.2,37.4
of,37.4,37.5
it,37.5,37.7
and,37.7,37.8
I,37.8,37.9
guess,37.9,38.1
to,38.1,38.3
the,38.3,38.5
altar,38.5,39.4
left,39.4,39.7
I,42.6,42.9
guess,42.9,43.2
you,43.2,43.4
left,43.4,43.6
yeah,48.4,48.9
but,48.9,49.1
like,49.1,49.3
so,49.3,50.0
just,50.0,50.5
going,50.5,50.6
to,50.6,50.7
be,50.7,50.7
a,50.7,50.8
little,50.8,50.9
bit,50.9,51.1
less,51.1,51.3
so,51.3,51.4
it'll,51.4,51.6
be,51.6,51.7
more,51.7,51.9
in,51.9,52.2
front,52.2,52.4
of,52.4,52.4
it,52.4,52.6
then,52.6,52.7
left,52.7,53.0
and,53.0,54.0
then,54.0,54.2
I,54.2,54.3
guess,54.3,54.5
put,54.5,54.7
it,54.7,54.8
like,54.8,55.0
a,55.0,55.2
half,55.2,55.6
block,55.6,56.1
space,56.1,56.4
in,56.4,56.5
between,56.5,56.6
them,56.6,57.1
all,59.5,59.9
right,59.9,60.3
and,60.3,61.1
then,61.1,61.5
so,65.6,66.0
those,66.0,66.3
okay,66.3,66.7
then,66.7,66.9
take,66.9,67.1
another,67.1,67.2
block,67.2,67.7
put,67.7,68.8
it,68.8,68.9
on,68.9,69.1
the,69.1,69.3
I,69.3,69.6
guess,69.6,69.8
your,69.8,70.1
left,70.1,70.4
of,70.4,70.6
the,70.6,70.8
of,70.8,71.5
those,71.5,71.8
two,71.8,72.0
blocks,72.0,72.2
that,72.2,72.4
are,72.4,72.6
like,72.6,72.8
one,72.8,73.0
from,73.0,73.2
the,73.2,73.3
other,73.3,73.4
I,74.0,75.5
know,75.5,75.8
on,75.8,76.0
the,76.0,76.1
side,76.1,76.3
but,76.3,76.4
I,76.4,76.5
guess,76.5,76.7
and,76.7,77.1
then,77.1,77.2
so,77.2,78.2
be,78.2,78.3
it,78.3,78.9
should,78.9,80.3
be,80.3,80.4
like,80.4,80.5
in,80.5,80.7
front,80.7,81.0
of,81.0,81.0
the,81.0,81.1
space,81.1,81.4
between,81.4,81.7
those,81.7,82.1
two,82.1,82.3
blocks,82.3,82.4
yeah,84.6,85.7
I,85.7,85.8
guess,85.8,86.0
it's,86.0,86.2
good,86.2,86.2
enough,86.2,86.4
thanks,86.4,87.0
looks,87.0,87.6
like,87.6,87.9
I,87.9,88.5
guess,88.5,88.7
just,88.7,88.8
push,88.8,89.1
it,89.1,89.1
like,89.1,89.5
forward,89.5,89.8
a,89.8,89.8
little,89.8,90.0
bit,90.0,90.1
all,92.0,92.4
right,92.4,92.5
yeah,92.5,92.7
that,92.7,92.8
was,92.8,93.0
pretty,93.0,93.1
good,93.1,93.3
and,94.3,94.7
then,94.7,95.1
the,95.1,95.2
block,95.2,95.5
for,95.5,95.7
that,95.7,95.9
corner,95.9,96.3
is,96.3,96.5
pointing,96.5,96.8
out,96.8,97.1
put,97.1,98.1
a,98.1,98.1
block,98.1,98.4
in,98.4,98.5
front,98.5,98.7
of,98.7,98.8
that,98.8,99.0
like,99.0,99.2
I,99.2,99.3
guess,99.3,99.5
a,99.5,99.6
third,99.6,100.8
of,100.8,100.8
a,100.8,100.9
black,100.9,101.2
space,101.2,101.6
it,101.6,101.7
looks,101.7,101.7
like,101.7,102.1
yeah,105.3,105.6
so,107.4,108.7
again,108.7,109.1
cool,109.1,110.2
