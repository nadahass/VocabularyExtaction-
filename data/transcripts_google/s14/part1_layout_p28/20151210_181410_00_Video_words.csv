grid,5.2,5.4
this,5.4,6.2
time,6.2,6.4
it,6.4,6.5
looks,6.5,6.6
like,6.6,7.0
it,7.0,8.5
starts,8.5,9.0
in,9.0,9.3
the,9.3,9.4
top,9.4,9.6
left,9.6,10.0
there's,10.0,10.3
a,10.3,10.3
block,10.3,10.6
and,10.6,11.8
then,11.8,11.9
I'm,11.9,12.2
going,12.2,12.4
to,12.4,12.4
go,12.4,12.5
down,12.5,12.8
and,12.8,12.9
Rose,12.9,13.4
this,13.4,13.6
time,13.6,14.0
so,14.0,14.4
there's,14.4,14.8
skip,14.8,15.2
one,15.2,15.4
rail,15.4,15.6
there's,15.6,15.9
another,15.9,16.1
block,16.1,16.4
Skip,17.7,18.3
One,18.3,18.5
routers,18.5,18.9
another,18.9,19.2
box,19.2,19.5
of,19.5,19.6
those,19.6,19.7
one,19.7,20.1
in,20.1,20.1
the,20.1,20.2
1st,20.2,20.6
3rd,20.6,20.8
and,20.8,20.8
5th,20.8,21.0
looking,21.0,22.7
at,22.7,22.8
the,22.8,22.9
second,22.9,23.2
column,23.2,24.0
it,24.0,24.4
kind,24.4,24.6
of,24.6,24.7
goes,24.7,24.8
down,24.8,25.2
diagonally,25.2,25.6
or,25.6,26.0
so,26.0,26.4
if,26.4,26.8
you're,26.8,27.2
right,27.2,29.0
there,29.0,29.2
a,29.2,30.1
skipper,30.1,30.5
oh,30.5,30.7
yeah,30.7,31.8
right,31.8,32.0
there,32.0,32.2
in,32.2,34.0
the,34.0,34.1
same,34.1,34.3
thing,34.3,34.7
again,34.7,34.9
so,34.9,35.7
skip,35.7,36.2
it,36.2,36.4
starts,36.4,36.9
on,36.9,37.0
the,37.0,37.1

the,41.1,41.2
fifth,41.2,41.6
repeat,41.6,43.0
again,43.0,43.3
tonight,43.3,43.7
in,43.7,43.9
pattern,43.9,44.3
so,44.3,44.6
one,44.6,44.9
on,44.9,45.2
the,45.2,45.5
4th,45.5,46.2
I'm,46.2,47.6
going,47.6,47.6
to,47.6,48.0
go,48.0,48.1
back,48.1,48.3
on,48.3,48.6
this,48.6,48.9
next,48.9,49.3
call,49.3,49.5
I'm,49.5,49.6
going,49.6,49.8
to,49.8,49.9
go,49.9,50.1
