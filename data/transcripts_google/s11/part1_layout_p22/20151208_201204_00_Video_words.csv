again,2.1,2.4
each,2.4,4.7
one,4.7,4.9
of,4.9,5.0
them,5.0,5.3
is,5.3,5.6
6,5.6,6.2
blocks,6.2,6.6
high,6.6,6.8
go,11.3,11.7
to,11.7,11.8
start,11.8,12.1
by,12.1,12.2
making,12.2,12.4
one,12.4,12.6
of,12.6,12.9
the,12.9,12.9
towers,12.9,13.2
so,15.5,15.9
each,15.9,16.4
one,16.4,16.5
is,16.5,16.8
staggered,16.8,17.5
left,17.5,17.9
to,17.9,18.2
right,18.2,18.4
a,18.4,18.6
little,18.6,18.8
bit,18.8,19.0
maybe,19.0,19.9
one,19.9,20.4
fourth,20.4,20.8
of,20.8,20.8
the,20.8,20.9
block,20.9,21.3
slid,21.3,22.0
yep,22.0,22.5
and,22.5,22.7
then,22.7,22.9
the,22.9,23.0
next,23.0,23.1
one,23.1,23.3
flies,23.3,23.8
the,23.8,23.9
opposite,23.9,24.3
way,24.3,24.5
and,24.5,25.4
keep,25.4,25.6
going,25.6,25.8
like,25.8,26.1
that,26.1,26.2
and,31.2,31.6
your,31.6,31.8
other,31.8,32.0
Tower,32.0,32.5
will,32.5,32.7
just,32.7,33.0
be,33.0,33.2
the,33.2,33.6
foot,33.6,33.8
to,33.8,33.9
the,33.9,34.0
right,34.0,34.4
exactly,34.4,35.0
the,35.0,35.1
same,35.1,35.3
yeah,35.3,37.1
I,37.1,37.8
mean,37.8,38.0
I,38.0,38.1
don't,38.1,38.1
know,38.1,38.2
if,38.2,38.3
it,38.3,38.4
matters,38.4,38.6
but,38.6,39.0
centimeters,43.7,44.5
by,44.5,44.7
Paul,44.7,45.1
write,45.1,45.5
2.2,45.5,47.3
cm,47.3,47.7
per,47.7,48.1
inch,48.1,48.2
it,51.2,52.2
doesn't,52.2,52.4
matter,52.4,52.5
so,54.6,55.0
what,55.0,55.1
do,55.1,55.2
I,55.2,55.3
do,55.3,55.4
with,55.4,55.6
are,55.6,55.8
you,55.8,55.9
doing,55.9,56.0
exactly,56.0,56.4
the,56.4,56.6
same,56.6,56.8
in,56.8,57.4
the,57.4,57.5
same,57.5,57.6
