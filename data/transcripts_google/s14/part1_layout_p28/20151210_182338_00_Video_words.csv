this,0.8,1.3
one,1.3,1.5
is,1.5,1.6
also,1.6,1.9
another,1.9,2.2
three-dimensional,2.2,3.2
one,3.2,3.4
there's,4.4,6.3
going,6.3,6.5
to,6.5,6.5
be,6.5,6.6
four,6.6,7.8
blocks,7.8,8.3
at,8.3,8.5
804,8.5,10.1
kind,10.1,10.5
of,10.5,10.6
centered,10.6,11.2
in,11.2,11.3
the,11.3,11.5
grid,11.5,11.9
the,11.9,12.0
grids,12.0,12.5
not,12.5,15.3
as,15.3,15.5
relevant,15.5,15.8
there,15.8,16.8
cannot,16.8,17.1
not,17.1,17.4
be,17.4,17.5
up,17.5,17.9
a,17.9,18.2
square,18.2,18.6
rather,18.6,19.1
they're,19.1,19.6
going,19.6,19.7
to,19.7,19.8
be,19.8,20.0
Dimond,20.0,21.1
so,21.1,21.4
they're,21.4,21.6
going,21.6,21.7
to,21.7,21.8
be,21.8,21.9
turn,21.9,22.4
up,22.4,22.5
90°,22.5,23.2
each,23.2,24.0
block,24.0,24.3
90°,24.3,24.9
yep,24.9,25.1
just,25.1,25.9
like,25.9,26.0
that,26.0,26.3
I,28.6,28.9
would,28.9,29.1
separate,29.1,29.8
them,29.8,30.1
a,30.1,30.3
little,30.3,30.9
separate,30.9,31.6
the,31.6,31.7
ones,31.7,31.9
you,31.9,32.2
left,32.2,32.4
and,32.4,32.7
right,32.7,32.7
yet,32.7,33.4
the,33.4,34.0
front,34.0,34.3
and,34.3,34.4
back,34.4,34.5
aren't,34.5,34.9
as,34.9,35.0
much,35.0,35.2
separated,35.2,35.7
it's,36.3,38.5
all,38.5,38.7
good,38.7,38.8
shape,38.8,39.3
of,39.3,39.4
this,39.4,39.6
is,39.6,41.3
let's,46.5,47.0
do,47.0,47.2
the,47.2,47.4
left,47.4,47.7
and,47.7,47.8
right,47.8,47.9
so,47.9,48.4
focus,48.4,48.8
on,48.8,48.9
the,48.9,49.0
left,49.0,49.3
and,49.3,49.3
right,49.3,49.5
locks,49.5,50.4
I,50.4,50.5
hate,50.5,50.7
zero,50.7,50.9
put,50.9,51.5
one,51.5,52.2
block,52.2,52.9
on,52.9,53.0
top,53.0,53.3
of,53.3,53.5
each,53.5,53.7
though,53.7,54.4
they're,54.4,54.9
not,54.9,55.3
diamond,55.3,56.0
shapes,56.0,56.4
their,56.4,56.6
square-shaped,56.6,57.2
now,57.2,57.6
yes,57.6,58.5
it's,58.5,58.6
like,58.6,58.8
that,58.8,58.9
there,60.4,60.8
is,60.8,61.3
now,63.9,64.4
focus,64.4,65.6
on,65.6,65.8
the,65.8,66.1
front,66.1,66.6
and,66.6,66.7
back,66.7,66.8
diamonds,66.8,68.0
there,68.0,68.9
is,68.9,69.3
there,69.3,70.3
still,70.3,70.5
there's,70.5,71.4
going,71.4,71.5
to,71.5,71.5
be,71.5,71.6
a,71.6,71.7
block,71.7,71.9
on,71.9,72.1
top,72.1,72.2
of,72.2,72.4
each,72.4,72.5
one,72.5,72.6
of,72.6,72.8
those,72.8,73.0
but,73.0,73.4
they're,73.4,73.5
still,73.5,73.8
diamond-shaped,73.8,74.4
and,74.4,75.7
they're,75.7,75.8
going,75.8,75.9
to,75.9,76.0
be,76.0,76.1
built,76.1,76.3
in,76.3,76.4
a,76.4,76.5
pyramidal,76.5,77.0
pure,77.0,77.7
middleweight,77.7,78.4
I,78.4,78.4
guess,78.4,78.7
so,78.7,79.3
move,79.3,79.8
the,79.8,80.0
block,80.0,80.7
on,80.7,80.8
top,80.8,81.1
of,81.1,81.2
you,81.2,81.4
either,81.4,81.4
one,81.4,81.7
of,81.7,81.8
those,81.8,81.9
I-80,81.9,82.6
near,82.6,83.0
eat,83.0,83.3
near,83.3,83.7
to,83.7,84.0
each,84.0,84.1
other,84.1,84.3
not,84.3,84.8
those,84.8,85.1
ones,85.1,85.3
but,85.3,85.8
the,85.8,85.9
ones,85.9,85.9
on,85.9,86.6
there,86.6,88.1
going,88.1,88.2
to,88.2,88.3
be,88.3,88.3
an,88.3,89.3
appears,89.3,89.7
that,89.7,89.8
they're,89.8,90.0
not,90.0,90.2
quite,90.2,90.6
touching,90.6,91.0
but,91.0,92.1
they're,92.1,92.2
more,92.2,92.6
near,92.6,92.9
to,92.9,93.1
each,93.1,93.2
other,93.2,93.4
so,93.4,94.0
you,94.0,94.2
might,94.2,94.4
want,94.4,94.6
to,94.6,94.6
move,94.6,94.7
the,94.7,94.8
blocks,94.8,95.2
of,95.2,95.4
heights,95.4,95.7
zero,95.7,96.0
farther,96.0,96.8
away,96.8,96.9
from,96.9,97.2
each,97.2,97.3
other,97.3,97.4
yeah,97.4,97.8
but,97.8,98.5
only,98.5,98.6
the,98.6,98.9
ones,98.9,99.2
nearest,99.2,99.6
and,99.6,99.6
farthest,99.6,99.8
you,99.8,100.2
not,100.2,100.4
the,100.4,100.5
ones,100.5,100.7
on,100.7,100.7
the,100.7,100.8
left,100.8,100.9
or,100.9,101.1
the,101.1,101.2
right,101.2,101.3
then,102.4,104.6
there,104.6,105.7
is,105.7,106.0
a,106.0,106.6
block,106.6,107.2
stacked,107.2,108.3
on,108.3,108.4
top,108.4,108.5
of,108.5,108.8
those,108.8,109.0
two,109.0,109.4
that,109.4,110.7
you,110.7,110.8
just,110.8,111.0
made,111.0,111.3
yet,111.3,112.2
it,112.2,112.4
looks,112.4,112.6
like,112.6,112.8
it's,112.8,113.1
whatever,113.1,115.1
I,115.1,115.4
haven't,115.4,115.9
checked,115.9,116.1
yet,116.1,116.3
again,116.3,116.5
and,116.5,117.7
then,117.7,117.9
focusing,117.9,119.3
on,119.3,119.4
the,119.4,119.5
ones,119.5,119.7
on,119.7,119.8
the,119.8,119.8
left,119.8,119.9
or,119.9,120.2
the,120.2,120.3
right,120.3,120.3
there,120.3,121.2
is,121.2,121.3
diamond,121.3,122.6
shaped,122.6,123.0
ones,123.0,123.3
on,123.3,123.4
this,123.4,123.6
they're,123.6,124.3
not,124.3,124.5
touching,124.5,124.9
the,124.9,125.0
ones,125.0,125.2
in,125.2,125.3
the,125.3,125.4
middle,125.4,125.5
and,127.6,128.3
that,128.3,128.7
looks,128.7,129.0
about,129.0,129.2
right,129.2,129.4
