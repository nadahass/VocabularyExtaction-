right,0.9,1.3
put,1.3,1.5
a,1.5,1.5
block,1.5,1.9
down,1.9,2.2
how,6.7,7.1
to,7.1,7.2
block,7.2,7.6
one,7.6,8.0
block,8.0,8.5
apart,8.5,9.1
behind,9.1,9.8
so,9.8,10.4
towards,10.4,10.8
you,10.8,11.0
put,12.8,14.3
two,14.3,14.6
blocks,14.6,15.3
kind,16.3,16.9
of,16.9,17.0
like,17.0,17.8
about,17.8,18.8
1/3,18.8,19.3
of,19.3,19.4
a,19.4,19.4
block,19.4,19.8
of,19.8,19.9
parts,19.9,20.3
of,20.3,20.4
more,20.4,20.7
closer,20.7,21.1
than,21.1,21.2
that,21.2,21.5
alright,23.1,25.2
then,25.2,25.5
stick,25.5,26.0
now,26.0,26.6
that,26.6,26.9
doesn't,26.9,27.0
look,27.0,27.2
like,27.2,27.2
it's,27.2,27.5
going,27.5,27.6
to,27.6,27.6
work,27.6,27.7
I,28.8,29.6
think,29.6,29.8
everything,29.8,30.2
needs,30.2,30.2
to,30.2,30.4
be,30.4,30.4
slightly,30.4,30.7
closer,30.7,31.1
together,31.1,31.4
now,32.9,33.7
stick,33.7,34.3
a,34.3,34.3
block,34.3,34.9
on,34.9,35.4
the,35.4,36.2
front,36.2,36.8
one,36.8,37.2
and,37.2,37.7
the,37.7,38.1
one,38.1,38.4
to,38.4,38.7
your,38.7,38.9
left,38.9,39.6
no,41.1,41.9
I,41.9,42.4
move,42.4,42.6
it,42.6,42.8
so,42.8,42.9
it's,42.9,43.1
on,43.1,43.4
the,43.4,43.5
front,43.5,44.0
front,44.0,44.5
one,44.5,44.8
and,44.8,45.4
the,45.4,45.5
one,45.5,45.8
you,45.8,45.9
just,45.9,46.0
put,46.0,46.3
it,46.3,46.4
on,46.4,46.5
and,47.4,47.9
turn,47.9,48.2
it,48.2,48.3
so,48.3,48.5
it's,48.5,48.7
parallel,48.7,49.2
yes,49.2,50.5
and,51.4,51.8
do,51.8,51.9
the,51.9,52.0
exact,52.0,52.4
same,52.4,52.5
thing,52.5,52.8
they,52.8,53.1
are,53.1,53.2
yes,53.2,53.6
and,53.6,54.4
then,54.4,54.8
there,54.8,55.4
must,55.4,55.5
be,55.5,55.7
one,55.7,55.9
that,55.9,56.7
I'm,56.7,56.8
having,56.8,56.9
a,56.9,57.1
hard,57.1,57.3
time,57.3,57.4
and,58.5,59.0
behind,59.0,59.5
so,59.5,61.0
put,61.0,61.4
put,61.4,61.5
a,61.5,61.7
block,61.7,62.0
on,62.0,62.1
the,62.1,62.4
back,62.4,62.8
block,62.8,63.1
good,63.1,63.3
and,63.3,63.8
then,63.8,63.9
put,63.9,64.1
one,64.1,64.3
on,64.3,64.5
the,64.5,64.6
top,64.6,64.9
in,64.9,65.2
the,65.2,65.3
middle,65.3,65.6
all,66.4,68.0
right,68.0,68.2
