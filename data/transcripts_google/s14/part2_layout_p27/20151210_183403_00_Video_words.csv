they're,7.6,7.7
going,7.7,7.8
to,7.8,7.9
be,7.9,8.0
like,8.0,8.1

three,21.5,21.8
columns,21.8,22.9
one,22.9,23.0
and,23.0,23.2
two,23.2,23.3
there's,23.3,23.5

the,24.2,24.2
middle,24.2,24.5
of,24.5,24.5
them,24.5,24.7
so,24.7,25.8
it's,25.8,25.9

that's,46.9,47.3
why,47.3,47.4
I,47.4,47.5
was,47.5,47.6
weird,47.6,47.9
you,52.7,53.6
got,53.6,53.7
one,53.7,53.9
right,53.9,54.1
there,54.1,54.3
at,54.3,55.0
the,55.0,55.1

on,67.2,68.3
your,68.3,68.5
other,68.5,68.5
side,68.5,68.8
it's,68.8,69.1
going,69.1,69.3
to,69.3,69.3
be,69.3,69.4
on,69.4,69.5
your,69.5,69.6
left,69.6,69.8
side,69.8,70.0
okay,74.5,75.0
so,75.0,75.2
starting,75.2,75.5
at,75.5,75.6
you,75.6,75.8
take,75.8,76.2
your,76.2,76.3
left,76.3,76.5
hand,76.5,76.8
upper,76.8,77.3
left,77.3,77.7
is,77.7,78.6
going,78.6,78.7
to,78.7,78.8
be,78.8,79.0
that's,79.0,79.5
your,79.5,79.7
like,79.7,79.9
you're,79.9,80.1
one,80.1,80.3
one,80.3,80.5
like,80.5,80.9
your,80.9,81.0
base,81.0,81.3
so,81.3,82.6
go,82.6,82.7
down,82.7,83.1
there,83.1,83.4
like,83.4,83.6
Row,83.6,83.8
3,83.8,84.1
and,85.3,87.6
then,87.6,88.0
looks,88.0,88.2
like,88.2,88.3
it's,88.3,88.5
going,88.5,88.6
to,88.6,88.7
ship,88.7,88.9
it,88.9,89.0
over,89.0,89.2
just,89.2,89.3
like,89.3,89.5
a,89.5,89.6
half,89.6,89.9
a,89.9,89.9
square,89.9,90.3
I'd,90.3,90.9
rather,90.9,91.1
take,91.1,92.6
the,92.6,92.8
first,92.8,93.1
one,93.1,93.2
up,93.2,93.3
and,93.3,93.4
you,93.4,93.5
ever,93.5,93.7
left,93.7,94.0
you,94.0,94.7
don't,94.7,94.9
need,94.9,95.0
that,95.0,95.0
one,95.0,95.3
and,95.3,96.4
then,96.4,96.5
you,96.5,96.6
just,96.6,96.7
kind,96.7,96.9
of,96.9,97.0
gun,97.0,97.1
at,97.1,97.3
the,97.3,97.6
corners,97.6,98.2
inside,98.2,98.7
corners,98.7,99.2
of,99.2,99.3
the,99.3,99.4
first,99.4,99.8
one,99.8,100.1
so,100.1,101.2
it's,101.2,102.4
going,102.4,102.5
to,102.5,102.6
be,102.6,102.6
in,102.6,102.9
Row,102.9,103.1
2,103.1,103.4
and,103.4,103.5
4,103.5,103.9
weather,105.8,107.5
all,107.5,109.6
that,109.6,109.8
for,109.8,110.0
that,110.0,110.2
column,110.2,110.7
then,110.7,111.0
going,111.0,111.1
to,111.1,111.2
do,111.2,111.3
it,111.3,111.3
again,111.3,111.4
on,111.4,112.3
those,112.3,112.7
ones,112.7,113.0
so,113.0,113.2
it,113.2,113.3
could,113.3,113.5
get,113.5,113.6
one,113.6,115.8
in,115.8,115.9
five,115.9,116.3
then,120.3,120.7
you're,120.7,120.8
going,120.8,120.9
to,120.9,121.0
go,121.0,121.0
in,121.0,121.3
one,121.3,121.6
more,121.6,121.9
back,121.9,122.7
to,122.7,122.8
the,122.8,122.9
three,122.9,124.0
and,124.0,124.1
four,124.1,124.2
then,128.0,128.5
you,128.5,128.5
going,128.5,128.6
to,128.6,128.7
go,128.7,128.8
out,128.8,128.9
one,128.9,129.4
more,129.4,129.4
back,129.4,130.0
to,130.0,130.1
one,130.1,130.6
and,130.6,130.7
five,130.7,131.0
and,132.2,132.6
then,132.6,132.7
you,132.7,132.7
got,132.7,132.8
to,132.8,132.9
go,132.9,133.0
down,133.0,133.5
to,133.5,133.5
three,133.5,133.7
and,133.7,133.8
four,133.8,133.9
and,133.9,134.2
then,134.2,134.3
down,134.3,134.5
to,134.5,134.5
one,134.5,134.8
so,136.5,136.9
you,136.9,137.0
just,137.0,137.2
reversing,137.2,137.6
a,137.6,137.8
hole,137.8,137.9
pattern,137.9,138.3
yeah,141.4,141.8
just,141.8,142.0
like,142.0,142.1
that,142.1,142.4
