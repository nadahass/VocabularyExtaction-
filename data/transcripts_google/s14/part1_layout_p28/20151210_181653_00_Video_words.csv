a,2.4,2.4
bit,2.4,2.7
more,2.7,2.8
complicated,2.8,3.2
this,3.2,4.9
is,4.9,5.2
a,5.2,5.3
three-dimensional,5.3,5.9
set,5.9,6.5
of,6.5,6.6

12348,10.4,11.8
go,11.8,13.8
some,13.8,14.8
of,14.8,14.9
the,14.9,15.0
blocks,15.0,15.4
are,15.4,15.5
not,15.5,15.6
directly,15.6,15.9
on,15.9,16.3
each,16.3,16.7
row,16.7,17.0
or,17.0,17.1
column,17.1,17.2
I'm,17.2,17.9
just,17.9,18.1
going,18.1,18.2
to,18.2,18.3
describe,18.3,18.7
the,18.7,18.9
picture,18.9,19.3
to,19.3,19.4
the,19.4,19.5
best,19.5,19.8
way,19.8,19.9
that,19.9,20.0
I,20.0,20.1
can,20.1,20.2
see,20.2,20.6
you,20.6,20.6
it,20.6,21.4
looks,21.4,21.7
like,21.7,21.8
the,21.8,22.1
blocks,22.1,22.5
start,22.5,23.2
on,23.2,23.9
the,23.9,25.1
second,25.1,25.6
row,25.6,25.9
in,25.9,27.0
about,27.0,27.3
half,27.3,27.7
way,27.7,27.8
down,27.8,28.2
in,28.2,29.0
between,29.0,29.1
the,29.1,29.4
second,29.4,29.8
and,29.8,29.8
third,29.8,30.0
call,30.0,30.3
so,31.3,31.7
however,31.7,31.9
that,31.9,32.1
works,32.1,32.4
visually,32.4,32.8
for,32.8,32.9
you,32.9,33.1
I,35.0,35.9
might,35.9,36.2
move,36.2,36.4
it,36.4,36.7
to,36.7,36.8
your,36.8,37.0
left,37.0,38.0
a,38.0,38.1
little,38.1,38.3
bit,38.3,38.6
yep,39.6,40.1
that,40.1,40.4
sounds,40.4,40.6
good,40.6,40.7
that,40.7,41.0
works,41.0,41.1
right,41.1,41.3
okay,41.3,42.4
then,44.4,45.0
Barrett,46.3,47.0
okay,51.6,52.2
start,52.2,52.6
at,52.6,52.8
index,52.8,53.2
call,53.2,53.4
Aries,53.4,53.7
in,53.7,53.8
their,53.8,54.0
clear,54.0,54.2
out,54.2,54.5
so,56.1,56.6
it,56.6,56.8
kind,56.8,57.0
of,57.0,57.1
looks,57.1,57.6
like,57.6,57.6
a,57.6,57.8
pyramid,57.8,58.2
I'm,58.2,59.5
just,59.5,59.6
going,59.6,59.7
to,59.7,59.8
describe,59.8,60.1
what,60.1,60.3
I,60.3,60.3
see,60.3,60.5
you,60.5,60.6
it,60.6,60.8
looks,60.8,61.0
like,61.0,61.1
a,61.1,61.3
pyramid,61.3,61.6
going,61.6,62.0
up,62.0,62.2
between,62.2,62.9
those,62.9,63.4
two,63.4,63.8
stacks,63.8,64.2
in,64.2,64.3
the,64.3,64.3
back,64.3,64.4
there's,64.4,65.7
two,65.7,66.1
blocks,66.1,66.4
in,66.4,66.4
the,66.4,66.5
base,66.5,66.9
at,66.9,67.3
I-80,67.3,67.7
then,67.7,68.7
goes,68.7,68.9
up,68.9,69.1
to,69.1,69.3
1,69.3,70.7
at,70.7,71.8
night,71.8,72.1
one,72.1,72.5
and,74.5,75.0
then,75.0,75.4
maybe,75.4,76.2
it's,76.2,76.5
3,76.5,76.8
in,76.8,76.9
the,76.9,77.0
back,77.0,77.3
but,79.9,80.2
yes,80.2,80.4
had,80.4,80.6
the,80.6,80.7
way,80.7,80.9
you're,80.9,81.0
doing,81.0,81.1
it,81.1,81.3
so,81.3,81.5
far,81.5,81.7
looks,81.7,82.0
cracked,82.0,82.3
and,82.3,82.6
then,82.6,83.0
there,83.0,83.6
is,83.6,84.0
there,84.0,84.6
so,84.6,84.8
it's,84.8,85.0
two,85.0,85.9
heights,85.9,86.2
tall,86.2,86.7
it's,86.7,87.0
there's,87.0,87.2
a,87.2,87.3
basiyo,87.3,87.9
there's,87.9,88.2
one,88.2,88.6
in,88.6,88.8
the,88.8,88.9
two,88.9,89.2
and,91.9,92.3
then,92.3,92.5
that,92.5,92.7
there's,92.7,92.9
a,92.9,93.0
second,93.0,93.5
stack,93.5,93.9
to,95.2,95.6
add,95.6,95.8
some,95.8,95.9
to,95.9,96.8
it's,96.8,97.2
right,97.2,97.6
to,97.6,98.0
your,98.0,98.3
right,98.3,98.6
Robert,99.7,101.8
some,103.1,103.7
yeah,105.3,105.7
move,105.7,106.7
that,106.7,107.0
top,107.0,107.4
walk,107.4,107.7
over,107.7,108.0
to,108.0,108.3
your,108.3,108.6
left,108.6,108.9
a,108.9,109.1
little,109.1,109.3
bit,109.3,109.4
yes,109.4,110.7
that,110.7,111.4
way,111.4,111.6
that,112.6,113.0
way,113.0,113.2
yes,113.2,113.4
and,114.4,114.8
I'm,114.8,114.9
see,114.9,115.1
I'm,115.1,115.2
not,115.2,115.3
sure,115.3,115.4
if,115.4,115.7
there's,115.7,115.9
a,115.9,116.0
block,116.0,116.3
underneath,116.3,116.5
it,116.5,117.0
to,117.0,117.1
supporting,117.1,117.6
it,117.6,117.7
more,117.7,117.9
but,117.9,118.2
there's,118.2,120.0
also,120.0,120.2
a,120.2,120.5
second,120.5,120.8
pyramid,120.8,121.4
next,121.4,122.7
to,122.7,122.8
it,122.8,122.9
over,122.9,123.0
here,123.0,123.3
that,123.3,123.4
looks,123.4,123.7
the,123.7,123.8
exact,123.8,124.3
same,124.3,124.4
but,124.4,124.9
opposite,124.9,125.3
so,125.3,125.5
going,125.5,125.7
towards,125.7,126.4
the,126.4,126.5
middle,126.5,126.8
again,126.8,126.8
yep,134.8,136.1
that,136.1,136.3
looks,136.3,136.3
right,136.3,136.6
show,140.6,140.8
me,140.8,140.9
a,140.9,141.0
two,141.0,141.2
blocks,141.2,141.5
left,141.5,141.8
okay,149.0,150.1
I'm,150.1,150.9
so,150.9,151.3
that,151.3,151.9
background,151.9,152.5
but,152.5,152.8
you,152.8,153.1
must,153.1,153.4
enter,153.4,153.5
blocks,153.5,154.0
at,154.0,154.2
Heights,154.2,154.6
zero,154.6,154.9
are,154.9,155.3
not,155.3,155.6
there,155.6,155.9
not,155.9,156.0
there,156.0,156.3
yep,158.2,158.7
you're,158.7,159.2
not,159.2,159.3
know,159.3,159.6
so,159.6,159.8
how,159.8,159.9
are,159.9,160.0
you,160.0,160.1
wouldn't,160.1,160.4
want,160.4,160.6
to,160.6,160.7
bounce,160.7,161.0
it,161.0,161.3
okay,164.4,165.5
that,166.4,167.5
same,167.5,167.9
pattern,167.9,168.4
is,168.4,168.6
repeated,168.6,168.8
one,168.8,170.3
row,170.3,171.1
closer,171.1,171.8
to,171.8,172.0
you,172.0,172.1
so,172.1,172.4
go,172.4,172.6
one,172.6,172.9
one,172.9,173.0
closer,173.0,173.5
to,173.5,173.5
you,173.5,173.6
that,173.6,173.7
same,173.7,174.1
pattern,174.1,174.5
is,174.5,174.7
repeated,174.7,174.8
though,174.8,175.8
it's,175.8,177.7
connected,177.7,177.8
The,177.8,179.1
Two,179.1,179.4
Towers,179.4,179.8
on,179.8,180.0
either,180.0,180.2

are,180.6,180.7
connected,180.7,181.3
to,181.3,181.5
each,181.5,181.5
other,181.5,181.7
yes,193.6,194.3
I'm,194.3,194.7
the,194.7,194.9
two,194.9,195.2
by,195.2,195.5
the,195.5,195.6
blocks,195.6,196.1
of,196.1,196.1
the,196.1,196.2
base,196.2,196.5
nearest,196.5,197.0
you,197.0,197.2
are,197.2,197.4
separated,197.4,198.0
a,198.0,198.1
little,198.1,198.1
bit,198.1,198.5
make,200.6,202.4
sure,202.4,202.6
they're,202.6,202.9
the,202.9,203.0
same,203.0,203.2
as,203.2,203.9
close,203.9,204.7
to,204.7,204.8
each,204.8,204.9
other,204.9,205.0
as,205.0,206.2
well,206.2,206.5
what's,208.9,209.4
a,209.4,209.4

yeah,212.3,212.7
the,212.7,213.5
spacing,213.5,214.0
is,214.0,214.0
a,214.0,214.1
little,214.1,214.3
off,214.3,214.5
at,214.5,214.7
8:02,214.7,215.4

at,215.7,215.9
Hyde,215.9,216.0
0,216.0,216.4

than,218.2,218.6
the,218.6,218.7
other,218.7,218.9
there,220.1,220.5
should,220.5,221.8
be,221.8,221.9
one,221.9,222.2
block,222.2,222.3
in,222.3,222.7
the,222.7,222.8

at,225.0,225.2
I-20,225.2,225.5
near,225.5,225.9
Sears,225.9,226.3
or,226.3,226.5
another,226.5,226.7

Robert,230.2,230.8
closer,230.8,231.4
to,231.4,231.5
you,231.5,231.7
I,231.7,231.9
hate,231.9,232.1
zero,232.1,232.4
yeah,233.4,233.8
I,236.0,236.1
can't,236.1,236.4
see,236.4,236.7
what,236.7,236.8
block,236.8,237.3
or,237.3,237.4
missing,237.4,237.8
one,244.4,244.8
here,244.8,245.1
YouTube,,245.7,246.8
yeah,246.8,247.3
it,247.3,247.6
appears,247.6,247.9
to,247.9,248.0
be,248.0,248.1
right,253.3,253.9
so,253.9,254.7
that,254.7,255.4
block,255.4,256.3
there's,256.3,256.8
two,256.8,257.2
in,257.2,257.3
the,257.3,257.4
very,257.4,257.6
back,257.6,257.7
those,258.4,260.0
that,260.0,260.1
hate,260.1,260.3
zero,260.3,260.7
then,260.7,261.2
there's,261.2,261.5
one,261.5,261.8
a,261.8,262.0
block,262.0,262.4
at,262.4,262.7
tight,262.7,264.0
blocking,264.0,265.5

of,265.7,265.8
them,265.8,266.0
closer,266.0,266.3
to,266.3,266.4
you,266.4,266.5
at,266.5,267.0
the,267.0,267.1
next,267.1,267.2
row,267.2,267.8
at,267.8,268.8
I-80,268.8,269.1
so,271.0,271.7
I,271.7,271.9
hate,271.9,272.0
zero,272.0,272.4
rather,272.4,272.7
so,275.2,275.5
not,275.5,275.7
the,275.7,275.9
blocks,275.9,276.2
in,276.2,276.3
the,276.3,276.3
very,276.3,276.7

next,277.9,278.1
up,278.1,278.5
yes,280.1,280.7
so,280.7,281.3
move,281.3,281.7
those,281.7,282.0
blocks,282.0,282.6
that,282.6,282.7
are,282.7,282.8
it,282.8,283.6
those,283.6,284.2

the,285.8,285.9
very,285.9,286.1
back,286.1,286.3
row,286.3,286.5
they,286.5,286.8
shouldn't,286.8,287.1
be,287.1,287.3
dependent,287.3,287.9
on,287.9,288.0
those,288.0,288.3
blocks,288.3,288.8
that,288.8,288.8
you're,288.8,289.0
touching,289.0,289.3
right,289.3,289.4
now,289.4,289.6
yep,291.0,291.5
they,291.5,291.6
should,291.6,291.8
be,291.8,291.8
pushed,291.8,292.2
back,292.2,292.2
those,292.2,292.8
two,292.8,292.9

that,293.1,293.3
you,293.3,293.5
now,293.5,294.2
are,294.2,294.7
there,294.7,295.5
yes,295.5,295.8
they,298.2,298.7
so,298.7,299.8
your,299.8,300.0
separate,300.0,300.5
those,300.5,300.7
those,300.7,300.9
two,300.9,301.2
