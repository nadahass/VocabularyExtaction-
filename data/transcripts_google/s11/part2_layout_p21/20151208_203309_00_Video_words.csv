let,3.5,4.5
me,4.5,4.5
just,4.5,4.6
analyzes,4.6,5.5
you,5.5,5.6
know,5.6,5.7
with,5.7,5.9
my,5.9,6.1
laser,6.1,6.5
vision,6.5,6.7
scraggly,13.0,14.7
okay,18.5,19.9
you,21.1,22.5
will,22.5,22.7
do,22.7,22.8
that,22.8,23.0
crying,23.0,23.2
to,23.2,23.3
my,23.3,23.5
understanding,23.5,24.3
of,24.3,24.5
the,24.5,24.8
situation,24.8,25.3
here,25.3,26.1
right,26.1,26.3
so,26.3,27.2
let's,27.2,27.3
let's,27.3,28.2
just,28.2,28.4
put,28.4,28.8
a,28.8,29.0
will,29.0,29.3
have,29.3,29.6
a,29.6,29.7
block,29.7,30.0
that,30.0,30.2
will,30.2,30.4
be,30.4,30.6
at,30.6,30.8
the,30.8,31.2
Forefront,31.2,32.0
okay,32.0,32.7
okay,32.7,33.6
great,33.6,33.9
and,33.9,34.6
then,34.6,34.9
to,34.9,35.3
behind,35.3,36.1
that,36.1,36.3
those,36.3,36.6
but,36.6,36.8
we,36.8,36.9
are,36.9,37.0
always,37.0,37.2
working,37.2,37.6
on,37.6,37.6
the,37.6,37.7
first,37.7,38.0
layer,38.0,38.2
here,38.2,38.5
yeah,38.5,38.9
there,38.9,40.0
will,40.0,40.1
just,40.1,40.2
be,40.2,40.5
a,40.5,40.6
block,40.6,41.3
separation,41.3,41.9
there,41.9,42.2
between,42.2,45.7
the,45.7,46.0
ones,46.0,46.3
that,46.3,46.4
are,46.4,46.5
closer,46.5,47.2
to,47.2,47.4
you,47.4,47.6
yeah,47.6,48.6
I'm,48.6,48.9
connected,48.9,49.4
to,49.4,49.5
the,49.5,49.6
corners,49.6,50.1
yes,50.1,50.7
okay,50.7,51.1
and,51.1,52.0
then,52.0,52.5
we'll,52.5,53.2
do,53.2,53.7
the,53.7,53.7
same,53.7,54.1
thing,54.1,54.4
with,54.4,55.4
two,55.4,55.6
other,55.6,55.8
blocks,55.8,56.3
on,56.3,56.8
a,56.8,56.9
thorough,56.9,57.5
then,58.3,59.9
let's,59.9,60.2
move,60.2,60.3
on,60.3,60.6
to,60.6,60.7
the,60.7,60.8
second,60.8,61.3
layer,61.3,61.6
let's,62.5,63.1
just,63.1,63.3
between,63.3,64.9
layer,64.9,65.3
1,65.3,65.6
and,65.6,65.8
2,65.8,66.0
will,66.0,66.7
place,66.7,67.1
two,67.1,67.3
blocks,67.3,67.4
between,67.4,69.4
lines,69.4,70.0
one,70.0,70.5
and,70.5,70.7
two,70.7,70.8
of,70.8,71.2
the,71.2,71.3
ones,71.3,71.6
that,71.6,71.6
are,71.6,71.7
farthest,71.7,72.3
from,72.3,72.5
you,72.5,72.8
yes,72.8,73.4
and,73.4,73.9
the,73.9,74.1
separation,74.1,74.5
there,74.5,74.9
will,74.9,76.0
be,76.0,76.3
a,76.3,76.5
little,76.5,76.8
bit,76.8,77.0
less,77.0,77.4
than,77.4,77.9
its,77.9,78.3
now,78.3,78.5
yes,79.7,80.2
and,80.2,80.8
you,80.8,80.9
can,80.9,81.0
bring,81.0,81.2
it,81.2,81.4
to,81.4,81.6
the,81.6,81.7
to,81.7,82.5
the,82.5,82.6
middle,82.6,83.0
of,83.0,83.1
the,83.1,83.3
side,83.3,83.7
of,83.7,83.8
the,83.8,83.9
block,83.9,84.1
just,84.1,84.9
in,84.9,85.0
terms,85.0,85.3
of,85.3,85.4
the,85.4,85.5
distance,85.5,86.0
between,86.0,86.1
the,86.1,86.6
front,86.6,87.6
most,87.6,87.9
okay,87.9,88.3
and,88.3,89.8
then,89.8,90.1
we,90.1,90.4
will,90.4,90.6
put,90.6,92.2
two,92.2,93.6
other,93.6,93.8
blocks,93.8,94.3
just,94.3,94.5
connecting,94.5,95.1
there,95.1,96.1
exactly,96.1,96.7
the,96.7,96.9
same,96.9,97.1
thing,97.1,97.3
on,97.3,97.4
the,97.4,97.5
other,97.5,97.6
side,97.6,98.1
and,98.7,100.3
we,100.3,100.6
will,100.6,100.7
play,100.7,101.1
after,101.1,101.5
they,101.5,101.9
are,101.9,102.1
now,102.1,102.3
Trump's,104.1,104.7
most,104.7,105.1
block,105.1,105.6
that,105.6,105.8
one,105.8,106.0
in,106.0,106.1
your,106.1,106.2
hand,106.2,106.4
Will,106.4,107.0
Go,107.0,107.3
On,107.3,107.6
Top,107.6,108.0
of,108.0,108.3
those,108.3,108.6
two,108.6,109.2
just,109.2,109.4
aligning,109.4,109.8
it,109.8,110.1
with,110.1,110.3
the,110.3,110.4
front,110.4,110.5
Okay,110.5,110.9
and,110.9,111.9
then,111.9,112.3
the,112.3,112.5
other,112.5,112.6
ones,112.6,113.3
will,113.3,114.2
follow,114.2,115.4
the,115.4,115.6
same,115.6,115.9
fashion,115.9,116.2
yeah,116.2,116.8
there,116.8,117.1
but,117.1,117.3
not,117.3,117.5
touching,117.5,118.0
the,118.0,118.2
corners,118.2,118.9
looks,122.6,123.8
about,123.8,123.9
right,123.9,124.2
