this one gets a bit more complicated this is a three-dimensional set of blocks there is one two three four five Roseville 12348 go some of the blocks are not directly on each row or column I'm just going to describe the picture to the best way that I can see you it looks like the blocks start on the second row in about half way down in between the second and third call,0.9157443046569824
so however that works visually for you,0.8645605444908142
 I might move it to your left a little bit,0.9843230247497559
 yep that sounds good that works right okay,0.7843632102012634
 then,0.9813939332962036
 Barrett,0.8124730587005615
 okay start at index call Aries in their clear out,0.8005720376968384
 so it kind of looks like a pyramid I'm just going to describe what I see you it looks like a pyramid going up between those two stacks in the back there's two blocks in the base at I-80 then goes up to 1 at night one,0.9360508918762207
 and then maybe it's 3 in the back,0.8313198685646057
 but yes had the way you're doing it so far looks cracked and then there is there so it's two heights tall it's there's a basiyo there's one in the two,0.9131830930709839
 and then that there's a second stack,0.8259393572807312
 to add some to it's right to your right,0.8722757697105408
 Robert,0.9613165855407715
 some,0.5531838536262512
 yeah move that top walk over to your left a little bit yes that way,0.9117652177810669
 that way yes,0.9102981090545654
 and I'm see I'm not sure if there's a block underneath it to supporting it more but there's also a second pyramid next to it over here that looks the exact same but opposite so going towards the middle again,0.917766273021698
 yep that looks right,0.5802475810050964
 show me a two blocks left,0.6393186450004578
 okay I'm so that background but you must enter blocks at Heights zero are not there not there,0.8336315155029297
 yep you're not know so how are you wouldn't want to bounce it,0.7864590883255005
 okay,0.5304188132286072
 that same pattern is repeated one row closer to you so go one one closer to you that same pattern is repeated though it's connected The Two Towers on either side are connected to each other,0.9413554072380066
 yes I'm the two by the blocks of the base nearest you are separated a little bit,0.8695141077041626
 make sure they're the same as close to each other as well,0.9350703358650208
 what's a cup of La Syria feed,0.5615727305412292
 yeah the spacing is a little off at 8:02 blocks at Hyde 0 ones a little farther forward than the other,0.686345636844635
 there should be one block in the very front at the base at I-20 near Sears or another block present,0.8939464688301086
 Robert closer to you I hate zero,0.9116746187210083
 yeah,0.8329526782035828
 I can't see what block or missing,0.8119908571243286
 one here,0.6580813527107239
 YouTube, yeah it appears to be,0.8889308571815491
 right so that block there's two in the very back,0.9547984004020691
 those that hate zero then there's one a block at tight blocking front of them closer to you at the next row at I-80,0.8542404770851135
 so I hate zero rather,0.6898444890975952
 so not the blocks in the very back row with the blocks next up,0.8621761202812195
 yes so move those blocks that are it those blocks that are stacked up in the very back row they shouldn't be dependent on those blocks that you're touching right now,0.9195759296417236
 yep they should be pushed back those two blocks that you now are there yes,0.9435349106788635
 they so your separate those those two blocks that are standing on top of it,0.8501983880996704
 does one see a movie Space Jam down to move that top walk-up height to and they put them next to each other yes like that we're not quite touching and then the block one Flacco's in the very top I hate to one block goes in front of it at nearest to you I hate you,0.924770176410675
 yep and then those two blocks at zero the now on the bottom of that stack pull them apart a little bit,0.9327280521392822
 and then yes that looks about right,0.9075082540512085
 what works best for describing it to you on that one,0.9021262526512146
 Hydro obviously was working,0.8428322076797485
 yeah I agree,0.8631547093391418
