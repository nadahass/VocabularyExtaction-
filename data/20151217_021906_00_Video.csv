this one like this,0.9843122959136963
 cool okay then you got a block in the center,0.8566838502883911
 okay then another block to the right like you're right and,0.8597031235694885
 I guess just a tiny space away like I guess that yeah that was pretty good and then I guess push it forward but I guess I get three fourths of a blocks length,0.9089099764823914
 okay and then,0.8179125785827637
 can I have,0.9668529033660889
 can I have a block on the left of it almost the same way you just put that other block,0.9213612675666809
 I guess just a little bigger space in between them,0.9752123951911926
 I think she pushed back a little,0.8848068118095398
 a little more,0.905010461807251
 are the other pretty good check then,0.8276886343955994
 can I have a block behind all three of those blocks but so it'd be like in a line with the first blotchy placed in the center it's going to be,0.9120538830757141
 behind every black like,0.9057990312576294
 okay it sounds like it's going to be like I guess two blocks basic behind that what it looks like,0.8898054361343384
 I wish you could see this picture,0.9802398681640625
 check then,0.8208694458007812
 going to have on the front and right black going to put a block bouncing on those two,0.9112358093261719
 then same thing with the center block in the left one,0.9496230483055115
 okay and then,0.9826309084892273
 right there,0.6139264106750488
 Xbox account of perplexing you going to take another block put it on the very back block,0.8736859560012817
 but halfway,0.8979636430740356
 so I can looks like it's hanging off I guess halfway,0.8796192407608032
 and then,0.9876290559768677
 you got to put a last block on top of all the all those three blocks on a second level,0.8838391304016113
 so how about that I guess I could probably push those back to you before then,0.884185791015625
