this,2.0,2.4
one,2.4,2.6
like,2.6,2.9
this,2.9,3.2
cool,7.9,8.4
okay,8.4,8.8
then,8.8,9.7
you,9.7,9.8
got,9.8,9.8
a,9.8,9.9
block,9.9,10.1
in,10.1,10.6
the,10.6,10.6
center,10.6,11.1
okay,14.5,15.0
then,15.0,15.3
another,15.3,15.6
block,15.6,16.1
to,16.1,16.3
the,16.3,16.5
right,16.5,17.2
like,17.2,17.4
you're,17.4,17.6
right,17.6,18.0
and,18.0,19.7
I,20.8,21.1
guess,21.1,21.3
just,21.3,21.5
a,21.5,21.7
tiny,21.7,22.0
space,22.0,22.4
away,22.4,22.7
like,22.7,23.0
I,23.0,23.0
guess,23.0,23.2
that,23.2,23.6
yeah,23.6,24.4
that,24.4,24.6
was,24.6,24.7
pretty,24.7,24.8
good,24.8,25.0
and,25.0,25.2
then,25.2,25.4
I,25.4,25.6
guess,25.6,25.9
push,25.9,26.3
it,26.3,26.4
forward,26.4,26.7
but,26.7,27.1
I,27.1,27.9
guess,27.9,28.1
I,28.1,28.2
get,28.2,28.3
three,28.3,28.6
fourths,28.6,28.7
of,28.7,28.9
a,28.9,29.1
blocks,29.1,29.5
length,29.5,30.1
okay,31.5,33.1
and,33.1,33.7
then,33.7,33.9
can,36.3,37.2
I,37.2,37.3
have,37.3,37.7
can,43.7,44.1
I,44.1,44.1
have,44.1,44.2
a,44.2,44.3
block,44.3,44.6
on,44.6,44.7
the,44.7,44.9
left,44.9,45.5
of,45.5,45.9
it,45.9,46.1
almost,46.1,47.3
the,47.3,47.6
same,47.6,47.8
way,47.8,48.5
you,48.5,48.6
just,48.6,48.8
put,48.8,48.9
that,48.9,49.1
other,49.1,49.2
block,49.2,49.6
I,50.9,51.3
guess,51.3,51.5
just,51.5,51.6
a,51.6,51.8
little,51.8,52.0
bigger,52.0,52.2
space,52.2,52.7
in,52.7,52.9
between,52.9,53.0
them,53.0,53.5
I,55.8,57.8
think,57.8,58.0
she,58.0,58.2
pushed,58.2,58.4
back,58.4,58.7
a,58.7,58.7
little,58.7,58.8
a,61.2,61.7
little,61.7,62.0
more,62.0,62.1
are,63.6,64.0
the,64.0,64.1
other,64.1,64.4
pretty,64.4,64.5
good,64.5,64.7
check,64.7,65.8
then,65.8,66.7
can,67.7,68.1
I,68.1,68.2
have,68.2,68.3
a,68.3,68.3
block,68.3,68.7
behind,68.7,68.9
all,68.9,69.5
three,69.5,69.8
of,69.8,69.8
those,69.8,69.9
blocks,69.9,70.4
but,70.4,70.7
so,70.7,71.9
it'd,71.9,72.1
be,72.1,72.1
like,72.1,72.4
in,72.4,72.6
a,72.6,72.6
line,72.6,72.9
with,72.9,73.1
the,73.1,73.2
first,73.2,73.5
blotchy,73.5,73.8
placed,73.8,74.1
in,74.1,74.2
the,74.2,74.3
center,74.3,74.5
it's,74.5,77.4
going,77.4,77.7
to,77.7,77.7
be,77.7,77.8
behind,79.3,80.0
every,80.0,80.0
black,80.0,80.4
like,80.4,80.6
okay,82.6,83.2
it,83.2,83.3
sounds,83.3,83.4
like,83.4,83.7
it's,83.7,83.9
going,83.9,84.0
to,84.0,84.1
be,84.1,84.2
like,84.2,84.3
I,84.3,84.5
guess,84.5,84.7
two,84.7,84.9
blocks,84.9,85.2
basic,85.2,85.5
behind,85.5,85.8
that,85.8,85.9
what,85.9,86.7
it,86.7,86.8
looks,86.8,86.9
like,86.9,87.0
I,99.4,99.7
wish,99.7,99.9
you,99.9,100.0
could,100.0,100.1
see,100.1,100.3
this,100.3,100.4
picture,100.4,100.6
check,103.6,104.3
then,104.3,104.9
going,105.9,106.4
to,106.4,106.5
have,106.5,106.8
on,106.8,107.5
the,107.5,107.6
front,107.6,107.8
and,107.8,108.1
right,108.1,108.4
black,108.4,108.7
going,108.7,109.5
to,109.5,109.6
put,109.6,109.8
a,109.8,109.9
block,109.9,110.3
bouncing,110.3,110.9
on,110.9,111.0
those,111.0,111.3
two,111.3,111.6
then,113.4,115.3
same,115.3,115.9
thing,115.9,116.2
with,116.2,116.3
the,116.3,116.4
center,116.4,117.0
block,117.0,117.1
in,117.1,117.3
the,117.3,117.4
left,117.4,117.7
one,117.7,117.9
okay,127.1,128.3
and,128.3,128.5
then,128.5,128.7
right,136.9,137.4
there,137.4,137.7
Xbox,140.2,141.3
account,141.3,141.5
of,141.5,141.6
perplexing,141.6,142.2
you,142.2,142.4
going,142.4,142.6
to,142.6,142.6
take,142.6,142.9
another,142.9,143.2
block,143.2,143.6
put,143.6,144.0
it,144.0,144.1
on,144.1,144.3
the,144.3,144.5
very,144.5,144.6
back,144.6,144.9
block,144.9,145.4
but,146.4,146.9
halfway,146.9,147.4
so,149.4,149.9
I,149.9,150.0
can,150.0,150.2
looks,150.2,150.5
like,150.5,150.6
it's,150.6,150.8
hanging,150.8,151.0
off,151.0,151.3
I,151.3,151.4
guess,151.4,151.7
halfway,151.7,152.4
and,155.5,156.0
then,156.0,156.4
you,157.5,157.8
got,157.8,158.0
to,158.0,158.0
put,158.0,158.3
a,158.3,158.8
last,158.8,159.2
block,159.2,159.6
on,159.6,159.8
top,159.8,160.0
of,160.0,160.1
all,160.1,160.2
the,160.2,160.3
all,160.3,161.0
those,161.0,161.2
three,161.2,161.4
blocks,161.4,161.8
on,161.8,161.9
a,161.9,161.9
second,161.9,162.3
level,162.3,162.6
so,164.0,164.4
how,164.4,164.6
about,164.6,164.7
that,164.7,164.9
I,164.9,165.3
guess,165.3,165.4
I,165.4,166.0
could,166.0,166.1
probably,166.1,166.3
push,166.3,166.7
those,166.7,167.0
back,167.0,167.2
to,167.2,167.4
you,167.4,167.4
before,167.4,167.5
then,167.5,168.0
