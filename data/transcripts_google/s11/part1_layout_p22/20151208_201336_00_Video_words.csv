okay,1.5,2.1
this,2.1,2.3
one's,2.3,2.6
easy,2.6,3.0
over,3.0,3.5
my,3.5,3.7
Astra,3.7,4.3
I,9.0,10.5
don't,10.5,10.7
know,10.7,10.7
if,10.7,10.8
that'll,10.8,11.0
make,11.0,11.1
it,11.1,11.2
easier,11.2,11.8
on,11.8,12.3
the,12.3,12.5
first,12.5,12.8
player,12.8,13.1
let's,13.1,13.6
start,13.6,13.9
with,13.9,14.0
that,14.0,14.2
several,16.3,18.0
blocks,18.0,18.6
Steve,18.6,19.9
6,21.6,22.6
blocks,22.6,22.9
Maybe,22.9,23.3
and,29.4,31.5
so,31.5,33.2
the,33.2,33.4
front,33.4,33.5
you,33.5,33.7
can,33.7,33.8
put,33.8,34.1
two,34.1,34.3
next,34.3,34.6
to,34.6,34.7
each,34.7,34.9
other,34.9,35.0
in,35.0,35.2
the,35.2,35.2
front,35.2,35.6
closest,37.3,38.4
to,38.4,38.6
you,38.6,38.7
I,41.5,42.0
have,42.0,42.4
the,42.4,43.1
right,43.1,43.9
side,43.9,44.4
out,44.4,44.9
a,44.9,45.9
little,45.9,46.2
closer,46.2,46.4
to,46.4,46.6
you,46.6,46.8
know,46.8,47.9
just,47.9,48.4
the,48.4,48.5
right,48.5,48.6
side,48.6,48.9
of,48.9,49.0
those,49.0,49.1
two,49.1,49.3
front,49.3,49.7
blocks,49.7,50.2
should,50.2,51.1
be,51.1,51.3
slightly,51.3,51.6
closer,51.6,51.9
okay,53.7,54.3
and,54.3,54.6
then,54.6,54.7
you,54.7,55.3
can,55.3,55.5
slide,55.5,55.9
one,55.9,56.1
block,56.1,56.5
behind,56.5,56.8
that,56.8,57.3
front,57.3,57.5
black,57.5,58.0
behind,63.0,63.8
the,63.8,63.9
one,63.9,64.1
that's,64.1,64.4
most,64.4,64.7
front,64.7,65.3
does,65.3,66.5
the,66.5,66.6
quantum,66.6,67.1
closest,67.1,67.6
you,67.6,67.7
know,67.7,69.0
not,69.0,69.3
behind,69.3,69.6
the,69.6,69.9
one,69.9,70.0
that's,70.0,70.3
closest,70.3,70.7
to,70.7,70.7
you,70.7,70.9
on,70.9,71.1
the,71.1,71.2
farther,71.2,71.6
side,71.6,72.0
no,76.8,78.1
no,78.1,78.2
exactly,79.5,80.3
yep,80.3,80.7
and,80.7,80.9
squeeze,80.9,81.2
it,81.2,81.2
together,81.2,81.4
yeah,85.1,85.7
but,85.7,86.1
no,86.1,86.2
gas,86.2,86.6
okay,90.9,91.5
and,91.5,92.0
then,92.0,92.1
one,92.1,93.5
more,93.5,93.8
block,93.8,94.0
behind,94.0,94.5
that,94.5,95.0
one,95.0,95.3
okay,98.8,99.5
well,99.5,99.9
yeah,99.9,100.1
I,100.1,102.2
guess,102.2,102.3
I,102.3,102.5
mean,102.5,102.7
in,102.7,102.8
front,102.8,103.0
yes,105.2,105.8
so,105.8,106.3
those,106.3,106.6
those,106.6,106.9
three,106.9,107.2
blocks,107.2,107.6
that,107.6,107.7
you,107.7,107.8
have,107.8,107.9
they,107.9,108.6
should,108.6,108.7
create,108.7,109.1
a,109.1,109.6
staircase,109.6,110.1
pattern,110.1,110.9
going,110.9,111.3
out,111.3,111.7
so,111.7,112.5
each,112.5,112.7
one,112.7,112.9
needs,112.9,113.1
to,113.1,113.2
be,113.2,113.3
slid,113.3,113.8
out,113.8,113.9
just,113.9,114.7
a,114.7,114.8
little,114.8,114.8
bit,114.8,115.1
yeah,115.1,117.0
exactly,117.0,117.8
and,117.8,118.4
then,118.4,118.7
yep,119.6,120.1
that,120.1,120.3
looks,120.3,120.4
right,120.4,120.7
okay,122.3,124.1
one,124.1,124.4
more,124.4,124.5
block,124.5,125.0
added,125.0,125.9
that's,128.8,129.3
it,129.3,129.5
up,129.5,129.7
the,129.7,130.0
farthest,130.0,130.7
one,130.7,131.0
in,131.0,131.5
farthest,131.5,132.5
from,132.5,132.9
you,132.9,133.2
but,133.2,134.3
one,134.3,134.5
more,134.5,134.7
block,134.7,134.9
but,134.9,135.7
on,135.7,135.9
the,135.9,135.9
inside,135.9,136.2
of,136.2,136.4
it,136.4,136.5
yeah,138.1,138.5
right,138.5,138.7
next,138.7,139.0
to,139.0,139.2
it,139.2,139.2
it,141.1,141.8
could,141.8,142.0
be,142.0,142.0
squeezed,142.0,142.6
all,142.6,143.0
the,143.0,143.1
way,143.1,143.2
in,143.2,143.4
closest,143.4,143.8
to,143.8,143.9
you,143.9,144.1
there,145.8,146.2
you,146.2,146.3
go,146.3,146.4
and,149.1,149.8
okay,151.2,151.8
one,151.8,152.1
more,152.1,152.2
block,152.2,152.7
you,156.6,157.0
can,157.0,157.1
put,157.1,157.3
it,157.3,157.4
right,157.4,157.5
in,157.5,157.6
the,157.6,157.7
gas,157.7,158.0
I,158.0,158.2
just,158.2,158.2
squeeze,158.2,159.4
it,159.4,159.5
into,159.5,159.8
that,159.8,160.1
hole,160.1,160.7
is,160.7,160.9
close,160.9,161.2
as,161.2,161.3
you,161.3,161.4
can,161.4,161.6
yeah,162.7,164.0
yep,165.3,167.1
okay,170.0,171.6
and,174.3,174.8
then,174.8,175.1
it,175.1,175.4
looks,175.4,175.5
like,175.5,175.6
there's,175.6,175.9
one,175.9,175.9
more,175.9,176.3
block,176.3,176.6
on,176.6,177.2
that,177.2,177.3
bottom,177.3,177.7
layer,177.7,178.0
and,178.0,179.2
it'll,179.2,179.5
be,179.5,179.6
all,179.6,180.2
the,180.2,180.3
way,180.3,180.4
on,180.4,180.7
the,180.7,180.7
left,180.7,181.0
next,181.0,181.9
to,181.9,182.1
the,182.1,182.1
one,182.1,182.3
you,182.3,182.4
just,182.4,182.5
slid,182.5,182.9
but,183.8,184.3
slightly,184.3,184.7
farther,184.7,185.0
back,185.0,185.5
away,185.5,185.7
from,185.7,185.9
you,185.9,186.0
away,186.0,187.2
from,187.2,187.4
you,187.4,187.6
just,187.6,187.7
a,187.7,187.9
little,187.9,188.0
bit,188.0,188.3
Yeah,189.4,189.7
but,189.7,190.0
not,190.0,190.1
as,190.1,190.3
far,190.3,190.5
as,190.5,190.6
the,190.6,190.8
the,190.8,191.1
last,191.1,191.3
row,191.3,191.6
dogs,193.1,193.6
good,193.6,193.8
okay,195.9,196.5
I,196.5,196.5
think,196.5,196.7
that's,196.7,197.0
all,197.0,197.2
first,197.2,197.5
layer,197.5,197.8
so,197.8,198.4
second,198.4,198.8
layer,198.8,199.1
is,200.3,201.0
4,201.0,202.3
blocks,202.3,202.8
there's,206.7,207.4
one,207.4,207.7
block,207.7,208.1
in,208.1,208.4
the,208.4,208.6
middle,208.6,208.9
of,208.9,209.0
the,209.0,209.2
two,209.2,209.4
closest,209.4,210.0
to,210.0,210.1
you,210.1,210.3
that's,213.3,213.8
about,213.8,213.9
right,213.9,214.1
and,214.1,214.6
then,214.6,215.0
3,215.0,215.6
blocks,215.6,216.1
in,216.1,217.1
just,217.1,217.4
about,217.4,217.6
a,217.6,217.8
horizontal,217.8,218.4
row,218.4,218.6
right,218.6,218.9
behind,218.9,218.9
that,218.9,219.4
yes,222.4,223.0
in,223.0,223.1
French,223.1,223.2
yep,229.7,230.8
in,230.8,230.9
the,230.9,231.0
one,231.0,231.3
farthest,231.3,231.6
to,231.6,231.8
the,231.8,231.8
right,231.8,232.0
should,232.0,232.3
hang,232.3,232.6
off,232.6,232.8
a,232.8,232.9
little,232.9,233.1
bit,233.1,233.3
like,233.3,234.3
you,234.3,234.4
have,234.4,234.6
it,234.6,234.7
I,234.7,234.8
think,234.8,234.9
it's,234.9,235.1
right,235.1,235.3
now,235.3,236.3
put,236.3,236.5
it,236.5,236.6
back,236.6,236.6
like,236.6,237.0
you,237.0,237.1
had,237.1,237.3
it,237.3,237.4
and,240.8,241.2
there,241.2,241.3
should,241.3,241.4
be,241.4,241.5
a,241.5,241.7
small,241.7,241.9
gap,241.9,242.4
between,242.4,242.4
the,242.4,242.9
one,242.9,243.1
farthest,243.1,243.7
on,243.7,244.1
the,244.1,244.1
right,244.1,244.5
that,244.5,244.7
you,244.7,244.8
just,244.8,245.1
touched,245.1,245.5
and,245.5,246.1
the,246.1,246.2
other,246.2,246.4
two,246.4,246.6
so,246.6,247.2
the,247.2,247.3
other,247.3,247.5
two,247.5,247.7
you,247.7,247.8
can,247.8,247.9
slide,247.9,248.5
the,248.5,249.4
other,249.4,249.4
way,249.4,249.8
oh,255.2,255.6
but,255.6,256.0
no,256.0,256.4
actually,256.4,257.0
I,257.0,257.4
told,257.4,257.6
you,257.6,257.8
the,257.8,257.9
wrong,257.9,258.1
way,258.1,258.3
sites,258.3,258.6
like,258.6,258.8
those,258.8,259.0
to,259.0,259.1
the,259.1,259.3
other,259.3,259.5
way,259.5,259.7
they,259.7,259.8
should,259.8,259.9
be,259.9,260.1
a,260.1,260.3
little,260.3,260.5
past,260.5,260.8
the,260.8,261.6
front,261.6,261.9
one,261.9,262.2
just,264.5,267.0
to,267.0,267.1
know,267.1,267.3
in,267.3,267.4
the,267.4,267.5
horizontal,267.5,267.8
Direction,267.8,268.2
like,268.2,268.7
you,268.7,268.8
were,268.8,268.9
doing,268.9,269.0
so,270.3,270.8
does,270.8,271.1
all,271.1,271.3
yep,271.3,271.7
stop,271.7,272.4
there,272.4,272.6
and,272.6,272.7
then,272.7,272.9
create,272.9,273.1
a,273.1,273.3
small,273.3,273.7
gap,273.7,274.1
between,274.1,274.1
those,274.1,274.7
two,274.7,274.9
and,274.9,275.1
the,275.1,275.1
last,275.1,275.4
one,275.4,275.9
a,278.7,279.0
little,279.0,279.4
less,279.4,279.6
okay,282.1,282.6
and,287.7,288.3
there,288.3,288.9
is,288.9,289.1
a,289.1,289.2
small,289.2,290.0
gap,290.0,290.3
between,290.3,290.3
those,290.3,290.8
first,290.8,291.1
ones,291.1,291.1
to,291.1,291.5
very,291.5,291.8
small,291.8,292.2
you,294.0,294.2
got,294.2,294.4
those,294.4,294.6
too,294.6,294.9
okay,295.9,296.4
I,296.4,296.9
think,296.9,297.1
that's,297.1,297.3
right,297.3,297.5
and,297.5,298.2
then,298.2,298.5
the,298.5,299.0
last,299.0,299.2
way,299.2,299.6
or,299.6,299.7
is,299.7,299.9
just,299.9,300.1
one,300.1,300.3
block,300.3,300.5
on,300.5,300.7
the,300.7,300.8
top,300.8,301.1
and,302.5,303.8
it,303.8,303.9
goes,303.9,304.2
in,304.2,304.4
the,304.4,304.4
middle,304.4,304.7
of,304.7,304.9
those,304.9,305.0
three,305.0,305.4
that,305.4,305.6
almost,305.6,305.9
form,305.9,306.2
a,306.2,306.3
square,306.3,306.6
on,306.6,307.0
your,307.0,307.2
left,307.2,307.4
side,307.4,307.7
put,308.6,309.0
it,309.0,309.1
right,309.1,309.2
on,309.2,309.5
top,309.5,309.8
of,309.8,310.0
those,310.0,310.1
in,310.1,310.3
the,310.3,310.4
middle,310.4,310.7
get,313.2,313.7
a,313.7,313.8
little,313.8,313.9
closer,313.9,314.3
to,314.3,314.4
you,314.4,314.7
yeah,318.2,318.6
okay,320.1,320.7
I,320.7,321.1
think,321.1,321.4
we,321.4,321.5
have,321.5,321.8
it,321.8,321.9
