okay,1.8,2.4
so,2.4,2.7
we,2.7,3.1
will,3.1,3.3
will,3.3,4.5
Bill,4.5,4.7
two,4.7,5.0
towers,5.0,5.4
and,5.4,5.6
one,5.6,5.8
of,5.8,5.9
them,5.9,6.1
was,6.1,6.8
like,6.8,7.0
Moodle,7.0,7.7
slightly,7.7,8.3
by,8.3,8.4
the,8.4,8.6
wind,8.6,9.0
okay,9.0,9.4
so,9.4,10.0
we,10.0,10.2
just,10.2,10.5
you,10.5,11.0
can,11.0,11.1
be,11.1,11.3
able,11.3,11.4
to,11.4,11.5
Tower,11.5,11.9
6,11.9,12.3
blocks,12.3,12.7
each,12.7,12.9
just,13.9,14.6
right,14.6,15.0
next,15.0,15.1
to,15.1,15.3
each,15.3,15.4
other,15.4,15.6
very,15.6,15.8
very,15.8,16.0
tight,16.0,16.7
and,16.7,17.5
then,17.5,17.8
we'll,17.8,18.0
apply,18.0,18.3
the,18.3,18.5
wind,18.5,18.9
effect,18.9,19.5
can,25.5,26.5
just,26.5,26.6
put,26.6,26.8
a,26.8,26.9
next,26.9,27.2
to,27.2,27.2
each,27.2,27.4
other,27.4,27.5
very,27.5,28.1
close,28.1,28.8
both,28.8,30.0
first,30.0,30.7
layer,30.7,31.0
should,31.0,31.2
touch,31.2,31.5
okay,34.2,34.8
so,34.8,35.7
we,35.7,36.0
will,36.0,36.2
take,36.2,36.4
the,36.4,36.7
one,36.7,36.9
that,36.9,37.0
it's,37.0,37.2
on,37.2,37.3
your,37.3,37.5
left,37.5,37.6
I,37.6,38.1
will,38.1,38.4
stop,38.4,38.8
over,38.8,38.8
in,38.8,39.0
a,39.0,39.2
little,39.2,39.2
bit,39.2,39.6
so,39.6,40.0
a,40.0,40.8
staggering,40.8,41.5
should,41.5,41.8
be,41.8,42.1
maybe,42.1,43.7
one,43.7,44.0
finger,44.0,44.2
like,44.2,44.8
this,44.8,45.0
I,46.0,46.4
seen,46.4,46.6
your,46.6,46.7
dad,46.7,47.0
wants,47.0,47.3
you,47.3,47.4
on,47.4,47.5
the,47.5,47.7
next,47.7,47.9
one,47.9,48.0
on,48.0,48.3
the,48.3,48.4
next,48.4,48.6
one,48.6,48.9
on,48.9,49.0
so,49.0,49.2
on,49.2,49.4
that's,52.2,52.8
that's,52.8,53.0
kind,53.0,53.3
of,53.3,53.4
too,53.4,53.6
much,53.6,53.7
so,53.7,54.6
maybe,54.6,54.9
less,54.9,55.3
half,55.3,56.2
a,56.2,56.3
finger,56.3,56.5
maybe,56.5,57.5
depends,57.5,57.9
on,57.9,58.0
the,58.0,58.1
thickness,58.1,58.4
of,58.4,58.5
your,58.5,58.6
finger,58.6,59.0
oh,63.0,63.3
yeah,63.3,63.6
that's,63.6,63.8
right,63.8,63.9
